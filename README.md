Vale (Verified Assembly Language for Everest)
=============================================

Vale is a tool for constructing formally verified high-performance assembly language code,
with an emphasis on cryptographic code.
It uses existing verification frameworks,
such as [Dafny](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny) and [F\*](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar),
for formal verification.
It supports multiple architectures, such as x86, x64, and ARM, and multiple platforms, such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Additional architectures and platforms can be supported with no changes to the Vale tool.

Vale is part of the [Everest project](https://project-everest.github.io), which aims to build and deploy a verified HTTPS stack.
